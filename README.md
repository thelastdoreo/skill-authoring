# skill-authoring

A Claude Code skill for writing, updating and auditing other Claude Code skills against a fixed structural and prose standard.

A skill instructs an operator; it does not convince them. It carries what to do, what not to do, and what to emit. Anything that argues a rule is right goes in a rationale file that never loads at runtime. Each stage is built from Work, Emit and Halt: an imperative action, a literal output template with named fields, and the exact text to emit on failure.

## Modes

| Mode | Invoke | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Update | `/skill-authoring my-skill --update` | Changes an existing skill, scoped to what you asked for. The default when no flag is given. |
| New | `/skill-authoring my-skill --new` | Builds a skill from scratch. Stops for you to confirm its shape before writing anything. |
| Audit | `/skill-authoring my-skill --audit` | Reviews a skill against the standard and proposes numbered changes. Applies nothing until you confirm. |

It also activates on requests like "update the X skill", "write a skill for X", or "audit this skill".

Every mode stops for your approval before it edits a file.
